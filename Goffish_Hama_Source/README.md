# GoFFish Hama Source Docker

Source image pulls the latest GoFFish-Hama repository and builds the jar on the go everytime we start the docker and initialise it using the **goffish init** command (explained below). It is also dependent on the base image, so make sure you've built or pulled the base image before you move on to Source Docker. 

Follow these steps to build and run the image

## Build it from source
 
    cd GoFFish_Hama_Docker/Goffish_Hama_Source/
    
    docker build -t sarthaksharma96/goffish-hama-source .
   
### or

## Pull the image from Dockerhub
    
    You can always fetch the latest image for use, directly from the DockerHub.

# Running the GoFFish Hama Cluster

You have several options to run this image:
- Running nodes one by one on local machine

- Running cluster on Docker Swarm Cluster

## 1. Running nodes one by one
### 1.1. Start the Master container

In order to use the Docker image you have just build or pulled use:

```
sudo docker run -i -t --name namenode -h namenode sarthaksharma96/goffish-hama-source /etc/bootstrap.sh -bash -namenode
```

### 1.2. Start the Slave/Worker container

In order to add worker nodes to the GoFFish cluster, use:

```
sudo docker run -i -t --link namenode:namenode --dns=namenode sarthaksharma96/goffish-hama-source /etc/bootstrap.sh -bash -datanode
```

## 2. Deploy the cluster to Docker Swarm.
In order to run GoFFish Cluster in distributed mode with Docker Compose (Version 3), first you need to prepare a [swarm cluster](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/create-swarm/).

Once the Swarm cluster is set up, use the [goffish_cluster.sh](https://github.com/sarthaksharma/GoFFish_Hama_Docker/blob/master/Goffish_Hama_Source/goffish_cluster.sh) on the Master Node to start, login, scale, visualise and stop the cluster.

```
./goffish_cluster.sh start                              // To start the Cluster

./goffish_cluster.sh login                              // To login to the Master Node

./goffish_cluster.sh scale (No. of Workers)             // To scale out and add new workers

./goffish_cluster.sh visualise                          // To Start a Dashboard for Swarm Cluster

./goffish_cluster.sh stop                               // To stop the Cluster

```


# Executing a Sample GoFFish Example
## 1. Log into the Master Node
```

./goffish_cluster.sh login

```

## 2. Build the Jar from source and Load the Graphs to HDFS
It will pull the latest git repository of [GoFFish Version-3](https://github.com/dream-lab/goffish_v3), build the Jar on the go and show a list of algorithms available from the jar along with a list of available graphs from hdfs.
It will then display a list of instructions and commands available for execution.

```
goffish init

```
## 3. Run the sample GoFFish example from the List available to you
```
goffish run VertexCount /facebook-4P

```
